It was held under the patronage of the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation, K. D. Lal Kantha, together with the Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development, Wasantha Samarasinghe.\nMinister K. D. Lal kantha pointed out that while a concrete programme has long existed to safeguard paddy farmers, no such systematic plan had been developed for other crops. He stated that this is the first time a government is preparing a definitive programme to resolve the problems of big onion farmers, emphasising that the present government\u2019s objective is to protect all farmers and improve their living standards.\nDuring the discussion, it was highlighted that while seeking solutions to issues in the big onion sector, priority must be given to farmer-related challenges, while also ensuring onions are made available to consumers at affordable prices. The Minister further emphasised that all decisions must be based on accurate data.\nMatters relating to increasing big onion production and the pricing mechanism were discussed in detail. The Department of Agriculture also presented a report outlining strategies and actions for sustainable production and marketing related to local big onion cultivation.\nA planned programme is currently underway to increase big onion production from 17% in 2025 to 22% in 2026 and 27% in 2027.\nIt was also stressed that the government has decided to introduce a stable price for big onions in a manner that is fair to farmers. Lengthy discussions were held on steps that could be taken to improve storage and other facilities for farmers.\nFarmers pointed out that sharp price fluctuations caused by wide market gaps posed a major challenge, yet they continue with their cultivation amidst this risk. They requested the government to provide the necessary facilities to allow them to continue big onion cultivation as a sector that could generate significant income.\nAs many of the farmers engaged in this sector operate on small landholdings, Minister K. D. Lalkantha emphasised the need to consider such factors when calculating production costs and making policy decisions. He also urged all farmers to register under the Department of Agrarian Development so that necessary interventions can be made promptly in emergencies.\nFarmers expressed their appreciation to the government for intervening with a definitive programme, where something is being done for the first time to address their challenges. They noted their confidence in the present government and said they were ready to work together with it in seeking solutions.\nDeputy Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, Namal Karunaratne; Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation, D. P. Wickramasinghe; Senior Additional Secretary to the President, Kapila Janaka Bandara; Director General of Agriculture, Dr W. A. R. T. Wickramarachchi; senior officials of the Department of Agriculture; and a group of big onion farmers representing Dambulla and Galenbindunuwewa also took part in this discussion.","SEO_Score":2,"cleaned":"discussion held establish stable programme resolve issues faced local big onion farmers discussion aimed formulating systematic programme address issues faced local big onion farmers held morning 17 presidential secretariat held patronage minister agriculture livestock land irrigation k lal kantha together minister trade commerce food security cooperative development wasantha samarasinghe minister k lal kantha pointed concrete programme long existed safeguard paddy farmers systematic plan developed crops stated first time government preparing definitive programme resolve problems big onion farmers emphasising present government objective protect farmers improve living standards discussion highlighted seeking solutions issues big onion sector priority must given farmer related challenges also ensuring onions made available consumers affordable prices minister emphasised decisions must based accurate data matters relating increasing big onion production pricing mechanism discussed detail department agriculture also presented report outlining strategies actions sustainable production marketing related local big onion cultivation planned programme currently underway increase big onion production 17 2025 22 2026 27 2027 also stressed government decided introduce stable price big onions manner fair farmers lengthy discussions held steps could taken improve storage facilities farmers farmers pointed sharp price fluctuations caused wide market gaps posed major challenge yet continue cultivation amidst risk requested government provide necessary facilities allow continue big onion cultivation sector could generate significant income many farmers engaged sector operate small landholdings minister k lalkantha emphasised need consider factors calculating production costs making policy decisions also urged farmers register department agrarian development necessary interventions made promptly emergencies farmers expressed appreciation government intervening definitive programme something done first time address challenges noted confidence present government said ready work together seeking solutions deputy minister agriculture livestock namal karunaratne secretary ministry agriculture livestock lands irrigation p wickramasinghe senior additional secretary president kapila janaka bandara director general agriculture dr w r wickramarachchi senior officials department agriculture group big onion farmers representing dambulla galenbindunuwewa also took part discussion","topic_cluster":4,"sentiment_score":0.9886,"lexicon_score":2.0,"impact_score":2.9886,"impact_level":"High Opportunity","operational_tag":"economic","event_flag":"Major Event"},{"Source":"News.lk","Title":"Global Entrepreneurship Week 2025 Begins Under the Patronage of the Prime Minister","Link":"https:\/\/news.lk\/news\/global-entrepreneurship-week-2025-begins-under-the-patronage-of-the-prime-minister","Summary":"All sectors must work in collective effort to empower local entrepreneurs for a digital economy.","SEO_Score":2,"cleaned":"global entrepreneurship week 2025 begins patronage prime minister sectors must work collective effort empower local entrepreneurs digital economy","topic_cluster":4,"sentiment_score":0.0,"lexicon_score":2.0,"impact_score":2.0,"impact_level":"Opportunity","operational_tag":"utilities","event_flag":"Major Event"},{"Source":"Onlanka.com","Title":"IMF signals flexibility and support for Sri Lanka after devastating cyclone","Link":"https:\/\/www.onlanka.com\/news\/imf-signals-flexibility-and-support-for-sri-lanka-after-devastating-cyclone.html","Summary":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed deep sympathy and strong support for Sri Lanka following the destructive cyclone that hit the country last week, causing major flooding, loss of life, and widespread damage.\nThe post IMF signals flexibility and support for Sri Lanka after devastating cyclone appeared first on Sri Lanka News | Breaking News &amp;
